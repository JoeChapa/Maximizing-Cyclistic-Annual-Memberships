# Maximizing-Cyclistic-Annual-Memberships

This repository contains a case study for the Google Analytics' Professional Certification program. In this case study, we analyze Cyclistic, a bike-share service that offers its bikes on a membership basis or for single trips.

## Overview

To increase the number of annual memberships, the Cyclistic bike-share company has tasked me, a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team, with analyzing the behavior of casual riders and annual members. Based on my findings, I will provide recommendations to Cyclistic's stakeholders and executives, supported by compelling data visualizations.

## Data

The data used for this analysis was provided by Cyclistic and consists of bike-share trip data from the past 12 months, as well as information about customers and bike stations. You can access the data used from <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">the Divvy Tripdata website</a>. The files used are not included in this repo as they exceed the github file size limit. The data is also subject to this <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">licensed agreement.</a>

## Analysis

We conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data, and used data visualization techniques to communicate our findings. We also conducted statistical analysis to test hypotheses and identify potential drivers of annual membership.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend that Cyclistic:

1)  Offer promotions during peak usage hours, such as discounted rates for members.

2)  Implement a targeted digital marketing campaign to convert casual customers who use the service for decreased ride times between 3-10 AM.

3)  Consider planning specialized services or events for members during weekends, such as guided tours or group rides, to encourage more member customers to use our service for leisure.
