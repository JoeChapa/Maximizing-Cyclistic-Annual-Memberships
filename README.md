Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Cyclistic bike-share case study as part of the Google Analytics' Professional Certification.

## Overview
The Cyclistic bike-share company has seen a steady decline in annual memberships in recent years, with a significant increase in casual, one-time riders. In order to reverse this trend and increase annual memberships, Cyclistic has hired a data analyst to identify trends and insights that can inform a new marketing strategy.

## Data
The data used for this analysis was provided by Cyclistic and consists of bike-share trip data from the past 12 months, as well as information about customers and bike stations. You can access the data used from <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">the Divvy Tripdata website</a>. The files used are not included in this repo as they exceed the github file size limit. The data is also subject to this <a href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">licensed agreement.</a>

## Analysis
We conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data, and used data visualization techniques to communicate our findings. We also conducted statistical analysis to test hypotheses and identify potential drivers of annual membership.

## Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we recommend that Cyclistic:

1)  Offer promotions during peak usage hours, such as discounted rates for members.

2)  Implement a targeted digital marketing campaign to convert casual customers who use the service for decreased ride times between 3-10 AM.

3)  Consider planning specialized services or events for members during weekends, such as guided tours or group rides, to encourage more member customers to use our service for leisure.
implement targeted marketing campaigns to convert casual riders to annual members, with a focus on customers who use the service for commuting purposes during early morning hours. We also recommend that Cyclistic improve the bike-share user experience by addressing issues with bike availability and station capacity.
